        This page “tells the story” of a series of projects that began when I enrolled in Google’s Cybersecurity Professional Certificate program. Completing the program led me to take an unexpected journey that ended up going well beyond the concepts presented within the program itself. These projects illustrate not only my ability to apply what I have learned, but also my sense of curiosity.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
Google's 8-course program was fascinating and challenging! It covered security and networking fundamentals and introduced me to a wide variety of concepts, such as the NIST and the OWASP Top Ten. Through Google's in-course labs, I gained hands-on experience with several technologies including Linux, SQL and Python, as well as a crash-course on using the command line interface.

                <p>During the program, I began researching ways to practice the skills I was learning outside the course (especially after I'd completed the program). As a result, I converted one of my older Windows laptops to Linux (Mint) and began installing many of the applications I was learning about within the program itself. This was a critical step in my learning and development, because I started to explore capabilities (like virtualization) that Linux made much more accessible for me.

                <p>
Using my newly-converted Linux machine, I begin re-creating as many of the lab environments as possible that I'd experienced within Google's Cybersecurity courses. 

The applications I installed included Wireshark, Suricata, tcpdump, MySQL, Visual Studio and Jupyter notebook. But probably the most important developmment was my increasing comfort with working from the command line interface, which set the stage for a later project involving virtualization, application developmment and server management. What began purely as a professional development project led to an interesting discovery: I very much enjoyed writing my own code!

                <p>
The Cybersecurity program inspired me to further explore a number of additional topics and resources outside the direct scope of the program. For example, I completed several AI-related certifications from Google. 
This led me to experimenting further with how to make more effective use of AI. Initially, I was heavily reliant on AI for coding help. However, a trial-and-error approach allowed me to gain experience and, eventually, AI became more of an editor in my process. But partnering with an AI has remained a crucial tool in helping me learn unfamiliar concepts.

                <p>
Next I wanted to code my portfolio website without relying on a resource like Wix, which I’d used previously. The cybersecurity program had allowed me to become much more familiar with GitHub and I'd used AI to help me draft the code. I found that I was able to publish my new website much more quickly than I'd anticipated.

                  <p>                      
My initial website was a proof of concept. At first, I was publishing my code to GitHub far too often. These experiences eventually led me to buying and converting a modern laptop to a more advanced Linux distribution, which I used to write and test code much more effectively. But the iterative process - and learning from my mistakes - was an incredibly valuable experience.
